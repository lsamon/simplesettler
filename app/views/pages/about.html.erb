    <h1>About Us</h1>

    <h3>Our Mission</h3>

    <p>To create a world where anyone can belong anywhere, and be informed on the things that matter most when settling in a new city.</p>

    <h3>Our Story</h3>

    <p>Settling in a new place is never easy. For some, it can be terrifying as you are forced to start all over again from scratch.
    We create custom content to help you discover services you might not find without guidance from a local. Imagine having a local whisper into your ear about the best mobile phone carriers in Brisbane, transport apps to show you where to catch a train from in Sydney, daily deals your city of choice—or your fav blogger point you to the best burger joints in the country.</p>

Simple Settler aims to take the pain in settling away, making the transition as simple as possible by acting as a hub to the necessary information needed to connect new dwellers to their new place. We want to help you feel at home.</p>
