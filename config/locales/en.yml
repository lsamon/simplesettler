# Files in the config/locales directory are used for internationalization
# and are automatically loaded by Rails. If you want to use locales other
# than English, add the necessary files in this directory.
#
# To use the locales, use `I18n.t`:
#
#     I18n.t 'hello'
#
# In views, this is aliased to just `t`:
#
#     <%= t('hello') %>
#
# To use a different locale, set it with `I18n.locale`:
#
#     I18n.locale = :es
#
# This would use the information in config/locales/es.yml.
#
# To learn more, please read the Rails Internationalization guide
# available at http://guides.rubyonrails.org/i18n.html.

      content_html: <p>Adventists believe life is more than just the accumulation
        of "stuff".  It’s about more than just surviving. It means more than simply
        maximising pleasure and minimising pain. We believe every life is of infinite
        value. Why? Because every human is miraculously crafted by God who wants us
        to live life to the full. What's more, He sent His Son to demonstrate true
        love, forgiveness and grace.</p>
